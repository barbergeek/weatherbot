#!/usr/bin/env python3
# owm-weatherbot.py
#
# Python script to grab temperature data from OpenWeathermap and display on scrollphathd. This script shows the current temperature along with an indicator of
#  the temperature trend (same, going up, going down), averaged over a given period of time. It also shows a small line at the bottom which indicates current 
#  wind speed and gusts. Current speed is shown using a brighter color and gusts are show using a dimmer color.
#
# Development environment: Python v3 on a Raspberry Pi Zero-W running Raspbian, default scrollphathd libraries, and pyowm python library.
#
# Original version by Mark Ehr, 1/12/18. Released to the public domain with no warranties expressed or implied. Or something along those lines. Feel free to use
#	this code any way that you'd like. If you want to give me credit, that's great. 
# OWM version by Scott Hoge, 11/23/2020. Ditto the above. :-)
#
# Installation notes:
#    # pip3 install pyowm
#    * Do one of the following:
#    	# sudo apt-get install python3-scrollphathd 
#       # sudo pip3 install scrollphat
# 	# curl https://get.pimoroni.com/scrollphathd | bash
#    * The scrollphat requires I2C enabled. Make sure that is turned on in raspi-config if the install above doesn't enable it.
#    * You will need an OpenWeather API key, available for free at https://openweathermap.org. You just need a free "Current Weather Data" subscription, not one of the paid ones, though you're welcome to support them.
#    * export OWM_API_KEY with your API key in your .bashrc (export OWM_API_KEY <OWM API key value>)
#
# Note: if you want this to auto-run upon boot, add this line to the bottom of /etc/rc.local just above the "exit 0" line:
#	sudo python3 {path}/owm-weatherbot.py &
#
# Also note that if you receive an odd "Remote I/O" error, that's the scrollphathd's odd way of saying that it can't 
#	communicate with the display. Check the hardware connection to make sure all of the pins are seated. In my case, it
#	happened randomly until I re-soldered the header connections on the RPi as well as the hat.
